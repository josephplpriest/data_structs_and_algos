# A repository for Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Rust

## Motivations:

1. Examine various implementations and their tradeoffs (runtime complexity, storage space, etc)

2. Learn Rust's unit testing framework

3. Understanding helps understand various frameworks for processing large data and choosing correct implementations in software development. Columnar data storage and MPP databases as well as tools like Spark and Presto utilize low-level DSA implementations for processing data quickly, in parallel.
